End up + V-ing

* The couple **ended up** getting divorced.
* The restaurant was full, so we **ended up** ordering pizza.
* When post-it get bumped they flutter away in the breeze and end up labeling the bottom of people's shoes.
* The restaurant ended up closing because of the pandemic 

Turn out

The truth turned out to be stranger than we had expected.
It turns out that she had known him when they were children.
