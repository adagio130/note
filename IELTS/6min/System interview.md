Can we constrain this a littble bit so that we can actually go through 
fill you in the knowledge gaps

quick drilling down some numbers here

does it make sense so far


Steps:

- Clarifying the quetsion
1. descript the system's function
2. ask interviewer which part is the most concern
3. list the use cases
4. specify some key metrics
	1. how many users
	2. number of songs
	3. storage capacity( the size of  songs)
	4. replication
5. Firstly, give a rough and simple conponents
6. Secondly, design you database
	1. explain your decision-making proactivetly
7. explain your system how to mach the use case
8. identify the bottlenecks
	1. cache
9. load balancing
	1. identify the  tight resources(cpu, network bandwidth...)
	2. measure the tighten resources
10. think it big
