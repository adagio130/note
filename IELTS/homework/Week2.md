Do you have a favorite flower or plant?
The cherry blossoms come to my mind immediately, reminding me of the beauty when I took my first self-guided trip to Japan.

What kind of flowers and plants grow near where you live?
I don't really know what they are. 

Is it important to you to have flowers and plants in your home?
Not really, it's hard enough taking care of myself, let alone being responsible for another lifeâ€”even if it's just a plant.

Have you ever bought flowers for someone else?
Sure, considering the period of preserve, I bought the forever flowers for my girlfriend.
