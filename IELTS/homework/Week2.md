Do you have a favorite flower or plant?
The cherry blossoms come to my mind immediately, reminding me of the beauty when I took my first self-guided trip to Japan.

What kind of flowers and plants grow near where you live?
I don't really know what they are. 

Is it important to you to have flowers and plants in your home?
Not really, it's so difficult to take myself well, not mention to raise another life.

Have you ever bought flowers for someone else?
