I'm Hank, and I'm passionate about scuba diving. To be honest, I struggled with seasickness until around my 30th dive.  What keeps me diving is
the adorable marine animals, especially the clownfish. When you are approaching them, they'll retreat back into their sea anemone and stare at you. It's just so cute. I also enjoy challenging myself. One of my favorite activities is diving into shipwrecks, which requires excellent buoyancy control to ensure you don't get stuck. My dream is to travel to famous diving spots worldwide and experience the breathtaking underwater landscapes.

I work as a software engineer at Vertiv. For me, coding isn't just a jobâ€”it's like solving a complex puzzle. I'm fascinated by how software design can tackle real-world problems. However, like many in this field, I sometimes struggle with impostor syndrome. The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me on my toes, and there's always something new to learn. It's both a challenge and a motivator for me. Although I've made progress, I consider myself to be on a continual journey toward becoming extraordinary in my field.

Regarding my family background, I was raised in a traditional Asian household where compliments were seldom given which is contributing to my lack of self-confidence. In my attempts to gain recognition, I engaged in various unconventional activities just to get adults to notice me. Eventually, I realized that I couldn't get the affirmation I needed from my home environment, so I turned to external networks to build my self-esteem. After investing a considerable amount of time in rebuilding my confidence, I can now say that I'm doing okay.
