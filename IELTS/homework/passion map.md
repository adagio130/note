I'm Hank, and I'm passionate about scuba diving. To be honest, I struggled with seasickness until around my 30th dive.  What keeps me diving is
the adorable marine animals, especially the clownfish. When you are approaching them, they will retreat back into their sea anemone and stare at you. It's just so cute. I also enjoy challenging myself. One of my favorite activities is diving into shipwrecks, which requires excellent buoyancy control to ensure you don't get stuck.
