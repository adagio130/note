I'm Hank, and I'm passionate about scuba diving. To be honest, I struggled with seasickness until around my 30th dive.  What keeps me diving is
not only the shipwrecks but also the adorable marine animals, especially the clownfish. When you are approaching them, they will retreat back into their sea anemone and stare at you. It's so cute.
