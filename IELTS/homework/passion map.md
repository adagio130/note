I'm Hank, and I'm passionate about scuba diving. To be honest, I struggled with seasickness until around my 30th dive.  What keeps me diving is
the adorable marine animals, especially the clownfish. When you are approaching them, they'll retreat back into their sea anemone and stare at you. It's just so cute. I also enjoy challenging myself. One of my favorite activities is diving into shipwrecks, which requires excellent buoyancy control to ensure you don't get stuck. My dream is to travel to famous diving spots worldwide and experience the breathtaking underwater landscapes.

I work as a software engineer at Vertiv. For me, coding isn't just a jobâ€”it's like solving complex puzzles. I'm fascinated by how software design can tackle real-world problems. However, like many people in this field, I sometimes struggle with impostor syndrome. The fast iteration of  technology keeps me on my toes, and there's always something new to learn. It's both a challenge and a motivator for me. Although I've made some progress, I still think myself to be on a continual journey toward becoming extraordinary in my field.

Regarding my family background, I was raised in a traditional Asian household where compliments were seldom given which is contributing to my lack of self-confidence. In my attempts to gain recognition, I engaged in various unconventional activities just to get adults to notice me. Eventually, I realized that I couldn't get the affirmation I needed from my home environment, so I turned to external networks to build my self-esteem. After taking amount of time in rebuilding my confidence, I can say that I'm doing okay now.

I really enjoy experiencing things that I've never done before. I've planned a snowboarding trip for next year and started going to the ski school in Taipei just to learn how to properly wear the equipment. Another skill I'd like to acquire is technical diving. Once I get the certification, I can dive deeper and explore more underwater locations.
