1. Do you live in a house or a flat
	- I currently live in a flat. It's more affordable than living in a house here in Taipei.
1. What's your favorite room
	 - I don't have many options since my flat only has one room. 
2. Is there anything you want to change about your home
	- The part that I'd like to change is to make it bigger. However, that's not really possible, so moving to a new place might be a better solution.
1. Would you like to move to a different home in the future
	- Absolutely, yes. The flat I'm living now is too small, and I'd like to move to a more spacious one as soon as I can.

Home town

1. Where are you from
- Jilong
	- I was born and raised in Jilong, but I've lived in Taipei for the past few years.
- Kaohsiung
	- I'm from Kaohsiung, in southern Taiwan. I was born and raised there. But I moved to Taipei two years ago.

 2. Do you like your hometown? (why/why not)
- No feelings
	- It's okay. I don't have any strong feelings about Jilong but I had a good childhood there.
- Yes
	- Of course. It's almost always sunny in Kaouhsiung, and I've got many friends there. When I go back, we always get together

3. Do you think your hometown is a good place for young people?
- Yes
	- Yeah. It's a great place for young people. There's so much to do. We have a lot of parks, museums, nightclubs ... that kind of thing.
- No
	- Hmm. I would say no because there aren't many job opportunities. Most people find their work here in Taipei

4. Would you prefer to live somewhere else?(why)
- Maybe England
	- At the moment I'm planning to study in England, so I'm looking forward to living there and experiencing a different culture. I'll know what I like after I've lived in a few different places.
- No. Stay here.
	- No. Now that my life is here in Taipei, I don't see myself leaving. The older you get, the harder it is to relocate.
