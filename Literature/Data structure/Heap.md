## What is Heap
*  Is a **complete binary tree**
* The value of each node must be **no greater than (or no less than)** the value of its child nodes.

## Heap's properties
 * Insertion of an element into the Heap has a time complexity of O(logN)
 * Deletion of an element from the Heap has a time complexity of O(logN)
 * The maximum/minimum value in the Heap can be obtained with O(1) time complexity.

## Heap's Type
 * Max Heap: 
	 * Each node in the Heap has a value **no less than** its child nodes. Therefore, the top element (root node) has the **largest** value in the Heap.
 * Min Heap
	 * Each node in the Heap has a value **no larger than** its child nodes. Therefore, the top element (root node) has the **smallest** value in the Heap.
