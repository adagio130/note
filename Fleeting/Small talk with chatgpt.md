- I really relish the environment under the sea, especially the sensation of propelling myself forward with my fins
- I particularly enjoy the zero-gravity environment while diving. It's like experiencing a different world where the usual rules of gravity don't apply, allowing for a sense of freedom and transquility.
- one of the main reason I love this activity is because of my girlfriend's company. Being with ther make every moment more enjoyable and memorable.
