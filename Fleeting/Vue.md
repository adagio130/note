Declarative Rendering
- using a template syntax that extends HTML, we can describe how the HTML should look like based on JavaScript state.
- reative() only works on objects (including arrays and built-in types like `Map` and `Set`
- `ref()`, on the other hand, can take any value type and create an object that exposes the inner value under a `.value` property
